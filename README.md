# SSG Benchmark Repository

This repository is for benchmarking Static Site Generators (SSGs), primarily to analyze and identify performance issues in my own SSG, [hwaro](https://github.com/hahwul/hwaro).

## Purpose
- Focus on self-improvement: Not for comparing with other SSGs, but to find hwaro's flaws (e.g., build speed, memory usage, scaling).
- Use as an experimental space to enhance hwaro.
- Objectively assess strengths and weaknesses via benchmarks.

## Benchmarks Planned
- Build time for various site sizes.
- Memory/CPU usage.

## Targets

* hwaro
* jekyll
* hugo
* zola
* blades
* etc..

## Setup & Run

> TODO

Contributions or issues welcome for ideas!
